Blockchain is a chain-structured database system. Therefore, a block is the fundamental element of a blockchain. 
Every block contains basic elements such as Blockheader, Blocksize, Magic Number, Transaction Counter, and Transactions.


The ingenious creation of Bitcoin block structure makes itself an immutable and decentralized digital cryptocurrency, thus attracting developers to use Bitcoin as a tool for transforming current financial system. However, the attractive features of Bitcoin also draw attention of cyberattackers. 
The Bitcoin script system allows users to insert up to 80 bytes of arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions, making storing illegal information in the blockchain feasible. Therefore, Bitcoin can be a strong tool with high anonymity to store and transmit illegal information, and serve as the C&C infrastructure of blockchain-based botnets to launch attacks.
