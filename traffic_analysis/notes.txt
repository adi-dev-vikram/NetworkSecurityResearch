Notes for network traffic log analysis


The dataset is bidirectional NetFlow files. But what are bidirectional NetFlow files? Netflow is an internet protocol developed by Cisco. The goal of this protocol is to collect IP traffic information and monitor network traffic in order to have a clearer view about the network traffic flow. The main components of a NetFlow architecture are a NetFlow Exporter, a Netflow collector, and a Flow Storage. 

ZEEK or BRO is similar to netflow and generates detailed network traffic logs.


1.)  We are using log files generated by BRO Network Security Monitor as our dataset. The dataset we've choosen has about 20 million records ( about 2 GB in size) and has 22 features with a number of sub-features explained in the feature description sections that follow.

2.) Aim is to analyse the data set and come with some insight as to what kind of behaviour could be suspicious

3.) Preprocessing incluses dropping, imputing, normalizations etc.

4.) or extracting valuable statistical information, we then visualized those statistical information using the most appropriate plots (in our case, box plot was used extensively).

5.) important features are :
s.ip, dest.ip, s.port, dest.port, L4 Protocol and L3 , responding service, time_stamp, uid for each connection, SYN with no ACK, SYN with ACK , time duration b/w packets.

6.)  Some columns have a lot of missing values so we needed to impute.
float(len(df[df.proto=='tcp']))/len(df.proto)*100.0
The features uid, id.orig_h, id.resp_h, threat are removed without affecting our data's statistical integrity.

Dynamic range of these attributes. like simple auth or Http GET

if mode port == 80 and L4 tcp then fine but in majority of these sent packets if they are SYN then SYN flooding might be there.
